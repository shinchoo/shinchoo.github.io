##### Hi all, my name is Shin Choo. I hope you all get to learn and enjoy my posts :)
##### Some information about me is that I am a huge NBA fan, and even though I consider Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant and Stephen Curry as my favorites, I have special respect for Kobe Bryant because of his work ethics to survive among a place swarming with monsters. Learning from his Mamba Mentality, I want to apply the same mindset and passion to my Data Science projects. I hope you guys do too.

##### VD = R
##### Vivid Dream = Realization
